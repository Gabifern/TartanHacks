Our project is a video management and editing platform aimed at teachers, providing functionality for them to record videos. The core features of the app focus on eliminating distractions from whiteboard videos (like people) for educational purposes.

Key Technologies:
PyQt5 for creating the GUI that handles user interactions, including logging in, navigating dashboards, and managing video content.
OpenCV for implementing the person eliminator, which edits the video to remove people from the whiteboard area.

Goals:
The platform aims to improve the learning experience by offering a streamlined way for educators to manage video content.
The key advantage is video clarity, as teachers can remove distractions (people) in the video, helping students focus on the core content.
Flexibility for teachers to decide the level of privacy and focus in the content they share with students.
Overall, this project provides a dynamic solution for educators to efficiently manage their teaching videos, and ensure that students get the best possible learning experience through focused, unobstructed content.
